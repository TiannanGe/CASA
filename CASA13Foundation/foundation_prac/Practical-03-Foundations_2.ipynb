Better still, the order of the columns often doesn't matter as long as we know what the columns are called: it's easier to ask for the 'description column' than it is to ask for the 6th column since, for all we know, the description column might be in a different place for different files but they are all (relatively) likely to use the 'description' label for the column itself.\n",

    "```\n",
    "myData['Longitude'].index(max_lon)\n",
    "```\n",

All we've done is change what's _inside_ that index function to `max(myData['Longitude'])`. This is telling Python to find the _maximum_ value in the `myData['Longitude']` list. So to explain this in three steps, what we're doing is:\n",

    "\n",
    "Lerwick is a small town in [\n",
    "Shetlands](https://www.shetland.org/), way up to the North of mainland U.K. and somewhere I've wanted to go ever since I got back from [Orkney](https://www.orkney.com/)--but then I spent my honeymoon in the far North of [Iceland](https://www.westfjords.is/), so perhaps I just don't like being around lots of people... 🙃\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, this one _might_ be a tiny bit easier conceptually than the other problems, except that I've deliberately used a slightly different way of showing the output that might be confusing:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Print the location of Lerwick\n",
    "city = \"Lerwick\"\n",
    "print(f\"The town of {city} can be found at \" + \n",
    "      f\"{abs(myData['Longitude'][myData['Name'].index(city)])}ºW, {myData['Latitude'][myData['Name'].index(city)]}ºN\")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "The first thing to do is to pull apart the `print` statement: you can see that this is actually just two 'f-strings' joined by a `+`--having that at the end of the line tells Python that it should carry on to the next line. That's a handy way to make your code a little easier to read. If you're creating a list and it's getting a little long, then you can also continue a line using a `,` as well!\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first f-string\n",
    "The first string will help you to make sense of the second: f-strings allow you to 'interpolate' a variable into a string directly rather than having to have lots of `str(x) + \" some text \" + str(y)`. You can write `f\"{x} some text {y}\"` and Python will automatically convert the variables `x` and `y` to strings and replace `{x}` with the _value of `x`_ and `{y}` with the _value of `y`_. \n",
    "\n",
    "So here `f\"The town of {city} can be found at \"` becomes `f\"The town of Lerwick can be found at \"` because `{city}` is replaced by the value of the variable `city`. This makes for code that is easier for humans to read and so I'd consider that a good thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second f-string\n",
    "This one is hard because there's just a _lot_ of code there. But, again, if we start with what we recognise that it gets just a little bit more manageable... Also, it stands to reason that the only difference between the two outputs is that one asks for the 'Longitude' and the other for the 'Latitude'. So if you can make sense of one you have _automatically_ made sense of the other and don't need to work it all out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a part that you might recognise:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "myData['Name'].index(city)\n",
    "```\n",
    "You've _got_ this. This is just asking Python to work out the index of Lerwick (because `city = 'Lerwick'`). So it's a number. 5 in this case. And we can then think, 'OK so what does this return:\n",
    "```python \n",
    "myData['Longitude'][5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "And the answer is `-1.145`. That's the Longitude of Lerwick! There's just _one_ last thing: notice that we're talking about degrees West here. So the answer isn't a negative (because negative West degrees would be _East_!), it's the _absolute_ value. And that is the final piece of the puzzle: `abs(...)` gives us the absolute value of a number!"

Simply by changing the way that we stored the data in a 'data structure' (i.e. complex arrangement of lists, dictionaries, and variables) we were able to do away with lots of for loops and counters and conditions, and reduce many difficult operations to something that could be done on one line!
