Outside of academia, it’s rare to find a data scientist who works entirely on their own: most code is collaborative, as is most analysis! But collaborating effectively requires tools that: get out of the way of doing ‘stuff’; support teams in negotating conflicts in code; make it easy to share results; and make it easy to ensure that everyone is ‘on the same page’."
